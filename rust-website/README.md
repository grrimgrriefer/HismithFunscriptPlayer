# Rust Website

This project is a simple web application built using Rust. It serves as a starting point for building web applications with Rust's powerful features.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: Entry point of the application. Sets up the web server and initializes routing and handlers.
- `src/routes/mod.rs`: Defines the routes for the web application and registers them with the web server.
- `src/handlers/mod.rs`: Contains request handlers for the application, responding to specific routes.
- `src/models/mod.rs`: Defines data models used in the application.

## Getting Started

To build and run the project, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Then, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will start the web server, and you can access the application in your web browser.
